    An abstract base class for an object store.
    
    An object store is a system for storing and retrieving byte arrays (objects) using a unique key.
    
    The key is a unique identifier for the object, and can be used to retrieve the object from the store.
    
    The object store provides methods for storing, retrieving, and deleting objects, as well as checking if an object exists in the store.
    
    The object store may also provide a method for listing the keys of all objects in the store.
    
    Stateful implementations of the object store should provide a context manager interface, allowing the store to be used in a with statement.
